I am interested in building foundation models for genomics and epigenomics.
Beyond that, I like thinking about the intersection of the theory of computation, cognitive science and (machine) intelligence.
In parallel, I build tools, methods and datasets to advance research questions in climate science.
When appropriate, I like to apply and improve methods from deep learning.

During my undergrad at ETH Zurich, I worked with my supervisor [Nora Hollenstein](https://norahollenstein.github.io) to bridge rationale-based interpretability methods for natual language processing and psycholinguistic data like eye-tracking.

I also spent time as a part-time researcher at Lawrence Berkeley Lab working on large-scale deep learning for climte analytics, supervised by [Prabhat](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mr-Prabhat) and [Karthik Kashinath](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sNMCgVwAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Afterwards, I joined Nvidia as a research intern under supervision of [Anima Anandkumar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_Anandkumar), improving calibration of the FourCastNet neural weather model.

Currently I am a Masters student at Tsinghua University in [Wenwu Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7t2jzpgAAAAJ&hl=en)'s lab, connecting abstraction-based library learning, program synthesis and mathematical reasoning to enable machines to re-organize formal theories based on experience, allowing for better generalisation and interpretability.
