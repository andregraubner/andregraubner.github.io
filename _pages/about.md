I am interested in building genetic and epigenetic foundation models, for example with [State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752).

Before that I built tools, methods and datasets to advance research questions in climate science at Nvidia and the European Space Agency.
When appropriate, I like to apply and improve methods from deep learning.

During my undergrad at ETH Zurich, I worked with my supervisor [Nora Hollenstein](https://norahollenstein.github.io) to bridge rationale-based interpretability methods for natual language processing and psycholinguistic data like eye-tracking.

I also spent time as a part-time researcher at Lawrence Berkeley Lab working on large-scale deep learning for climte analytics, supervised by [Prabhat](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mr-Prabhat) and [Karthik Kashinath](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sNMCgVwAAAAJ&hl=en). As a follow-up, I co-led the creation of the [largest hand-crafted extreme weather dataset](https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/advancing-the-study-of-extreme-weather-events-with-data-deep-learning-methods-and-climate-analysis/) for the European Space Agency and built deep learning models on top of it.

Afterwards, I joined Nvidia as a research intern under supervision of [Anima Anandkumar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_Anandkumar), improving calibration of the FourCastNet neural weather model.

Currently I am a Masters student at Tsinghua University in [Wenwu Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7t2jzpgAAAAJ&hl=en)'s lab, connecting abstraction-based library learning, program synthesis and mathematical reasoning to enable machines to re-organize formal theories based on experience, allowing for better generalisation and interpretability.
